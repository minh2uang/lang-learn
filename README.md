This is a web app I made for myself to learn Spanish pronunciation through Youtube videos. The main idea is that you create and save short clips (a few seconds each) from a Youtube video of a person speaking, then over a few days try and imitate the same clips (this is also known as the shadowing technique). Anyone can use this to learn to speak a dialect, a language of their choosing or learn to sing a song.
